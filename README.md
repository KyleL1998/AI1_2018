# AI Project

Had the option to either write a 20 page paper or do a larger project and write a 5 page report on it. Project sounded infinitely more fun.

After having a hard time thinking about what I wanted to do aswell as having 2 failed starts to ideas. My mom inspired me to solve the TSP problem, and I decided to do it with a **Genetic Algorithm**

I wrote it in **processing** as I felt like this type of problem is much better represented with a visual aspect. The java translation is also included.

If you're at all curious I've included the report I wrote in the repo and in there you can find a google sheets with data about what happens when you play with the parameters.

I should note you will need processing installed to run it and as I said above I had 2 failed ideas and by the time I got to this one I was running out of time... so some of the code aint pretty.
